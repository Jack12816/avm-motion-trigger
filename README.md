![avm-trigger-daemon](docs/assets/logo-project.png)

This project targets the tracking of a human motion to trigger an action on an
AVM Smart Home actor. When a motion is detected, a light sensor can be checked
for the current ambient light level and if a configured threshold is passed,
the configured actor will be turn on for example.  The `avm-motion-triggerd`
daemon can be configured to send user defined actions, like turn an actor on,
off or just toggle it.
